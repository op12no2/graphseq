# MIDI graph sequencer

WIP. Just a UI at the moment.

### MIDI

On page load the sequencer will try and connect to loopMIDI on Windows and IAC on macOS; both of which can then be connected to your DAW.

### Examples

[Binary waterfall](https://op12no2.github.io/graphseq/sequencer.html?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/op12no2/graphseq/refs/heads/main/waterfall.json) - blue: channel 0, yellow: channel 1
