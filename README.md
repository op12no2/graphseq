Very early days.

Todo:-

- Note off!!!!
- Select network areas, delete, duplicate, etc.
- Extend note properties to have an array of pitches (so the graphs don't get crazy) with rendering options (random, all, seq, length, etc).
- Note rules 0(trigger, action)n. Including adding new notes and links etc. And editing self/other note properties.
- Agent Rules.
- Agent-Note interaction rules.
- Agent-Agent interaction rules. Possible with agents being eliminated.
- Meta rules to modify rules.
- Universe rules.
- Save/Open.
- Physics up/down left/right mean something.
- Endless... :)
