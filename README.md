# MIDI graph sequencer

WIP. Warning! - this very-alpha version only sends note on.

### MIDI

On page load the sequencer will try and connect to loopMIDI on Windows and IAC on macOS; both of which can then be connected to your DAW.

### Examples

Binary Waterfall [run](https://op12no2.github.io/graphseq/sequencer.html?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/op12no2/graphseq/refs/heads/main/waterfall.json) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY8j3bs4pKk)
